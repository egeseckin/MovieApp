# Movie App
 
I builded a Movie app which can be searched by any word. I used Lottie-ios for loading animations.
- Used Longinus for faster image renders
- Created on Xcode 13.4.1
- for iOS 15.0+

How to run:
- Download the project from main branch 
- Open MovieApp.xcodeproj
- After indexing finished on xcode, click on the any ios phone to run (ex. iPhone 12) then run it

About the app:

- When user open the app must enter a word to search and click the search button.
- User can scroll until the end of movie count.
- Movie Details can be seen by clicking on the movie
